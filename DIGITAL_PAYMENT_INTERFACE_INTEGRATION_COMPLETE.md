## Usage Example

```tsx
import { FlowPayDemo } from '@/src/FlowPayDemo';

// Full landing page
function App() {
  return <FlowPayDemo />;
}

// Or use components individually
import {
  FlowPayHero,
  PaymentFeatureGrid,
  PaymentTestimonials,
} from '@/ui/components/payment';

function CustomPage() {
  return (
    <>
      <FlowPayHero
        headline="Digital payments"
        highlightedText="reimagined"
        description="Experience the future of finance..."
        primaryCta={{ text: "Get started", href: "#" }}
      />
      <PaymentFeatureGrid
        headline="Features"

      />
    </>
  );
}
```

## Next Steps (Optional Enhancements)

2. Implement scroll-triggered animations
3. Add sticky navigation component
4. Create mobile menu functionality
5. Add more card animation variants
6. Implement parallax effects
7. Add A/B testing variants

## Dependencies

No new dependencies added. Uses existing:

- **Bundle Impact**: Minimal - uses existing dependencies
- **Rendering**: Optimized with React 19 compiler (no manual memo/useCallback)
- **Animations**: CSS-based (hardware accelerated)

## Notes

- Preserved all existing payment component functionality
- Maintained vertical slice ownership (payment domain)
- Components are composable and reusable
- Design elements adapted from HTML source with improvements
- Animations respect user motion preferences
- Mobile-first responsive design
