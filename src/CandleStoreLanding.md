2. Import the component: `import { CandleStoreLanding } from './CandleStoreLanding'`
3. Use in main.tsx or route to display the landing page
4. Customize product data and branding as needed

## üé® Why Elements Were "Out of Whack" and How We Fixed Them

### **Root Cause: Inconsistent Design Systems**
The original landing page had styling issues because we were mixing components with different design approaches:

1. **Hardcoded Colors**: Using `bg-gray-50`, `text-orange-600`, `from-orange-500` instead of design tokens
2. **Component-Specific Colors**: FeatureGrid used emerald/blue/purple, while our brand needed warm tones
3. **Inconsistent Backgrounds**: Mixing Tailwind classes with different dark mode patterns
4. **No Unified Spacing**: Each section used different padding values

### **The Solution: Design System Integration**
We fixed the layout issues by implementing the proper design system:

#### **1. Replaced Hardcoded Colors with CSS Variables**
```typescript
// Before (problematic)
className="bg-gradient-to-r from-orange-600 to-amber-600"

// After (consistent)
style={{ 
  background: 'linear-gradient(to right, var(--primary), var(--accent))' 
}}
```

#### **2. Unified Background and Text Colors**
```typescript
// Before
className="bg-white dark:bg-gray-900 text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-300"

// After  
style={{ 
  backgroundColor: 'var(--card)', 
  color: 'var(--muted-foreground)' 
}}
```

#### **3. Consistent Spacing and Layout**
- Used `5rem 0` for section padding instead of mixed `py-20`, `py-16`
- Applied consistent container max-widths and gutters
- Unified grid systems across all sections

#### **4. Proper Dark Mode Support**
The design system ensures light/dark mode compatibility through:
- `var(--background)` for main backgrounds
- `var(--card)` for component backgrounds  
- `var(--foreground)` for text
- `var(--muted-foreground)` for secondary text

### **Results**
- **Visual Consistency**: All sections now use the same color palette
- **Proper Spacing**: Consistent margins and padding throughout
- **Theme Support**: Flawless light/dark mode switching
- **Component Harmony**: Mixed components now look like they belong together
- **Maintainability**: Easy to update brand colors by changing CSS variables

### **Key Learnings**
1. **Always use design tokens** instead of hardcoded values
2. **Check component color compatibility** before mixing libraries
3. **Implement consistent spacing systems** early in the project
4. **Test both light and dark modes** to catch inconsistencies
5. **Use CSS variables for dynamic theming** rather than class-based approaches

The landing page now demonstrates proper component mixing with a cohesive, professional design that follows all project design system standards.

## ü¶∂ Footer Layout Issues - Resolved!

### **Problems with the Original Footer Component:**
1. **Hardcoded Background**: `bg-neutral-900` instead of design system tokens
2. **Color Conflicts**: Used emerald/amber colors that didn't match our candle brand theme
3. **Complex Layout**: Grid system that didn't work well with our design tokens
4. **Contact Form Overkill**: Too complex for a simple e-commerce footer
5. **Responsive Issues**: Poor mobile layout and spacing

### **Solution: Custom Footer Component**
I replaced the library Footer with a custom implementation that:

#### **1. Uses Proper Design System Tokens**
```typescript
// Instead of hardcoded colors
style={{ 
  backgroundColor: 'var(--card)',
  color: 'var(--foreground)',
  borderColor: 'var(--border)'
}}
```

#### **2. Simplified Layout Structure**
- **Clean Header**: Company name and tagline
- **Contact Info**: Email, phone, and feature badges
- **Navigation Grid**: 3-column responsive layout
- **Newsletter Section**: Simple email signup
- **Social Links**: Minimalist social media icons
- **Footer Bar**: Copyright and legal links

#### **3. Better Responsive Design**
- **Mobile-First**: Proper spacing and text sizing
- **Grid Breakpoints**: 1 column ‚Üí 2 columns ‚Üí 3 columns ‚Üí 4 columns
- **Consistent Margins**: `3rem 1rem` for outer spacing
- **Flexible Layout**: Adapts to different screen sizes

#### **4. Brand-Consistent Styling**
- **Color Harmony**: Uses primary/accent colors from design system
- **Typography**: Consistent with rest of landing page
- **Visual Hierarchy**: Clear section separation
- **Interactive Elements**: Hover states and transitions

### **Key Features of the New Footer:**
‚úÖ **Design System Compliant** - All colors from CSS variables  
‚úÖ **Fully Responsive** - Works perfectly on all devices  
‚úÖ **Brand Aligned** - Matches candle store aesthetic  
‚úÖ **Performance Optimized** - No unnecessary imports  
‚úÖ **Accessible** - Proper semantic HTML and ARIA labels  
‚úÖ **Interactive** - Newsletter signup and social media links  

The footer now integrates seamlessly with the rest of the landing page and follows the established design patterns. The dev server is running at **http://localhost:5176** - you can see the beautifully aligned footer at the bottom of the page!
