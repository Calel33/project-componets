## Generated from UI-Integration-Template.md

```
I want to integrate a custom UI design into our Medical Healthcare Website project. Please extract and adapt this interface to work with our React + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS stack.

**CURRENT PROJECT CONTEXT:**
- Framework: React 19 + Next.js 15
- Styling: Tailwind CSS + shadcn/ui + Lucide Icons
- Backend: REST API (to be integrated)
- Language: TypeScript
- Target file: alimonyapp/componets/MedicalLanding.tsx (new component)
- Existing functionality: None (new landing page component)

**UI TO INTEGRATE:**
Source file: ideas/medical.html

This is a modern medical healthcare landing page featuring:
- Fixed navigation with glass-effect styling
- Hero section with animated elements
- Bento grid layout showcasing medical services
- Patient testimonials and ratings
- Emergency services information
- Technology and facility highlights
- Call-to-action sections
- Scroll-triggered animations
- Interactive hover effects

**INTEGRATION REQUIREMENTS:**
1. 🔄 **Preserve All Existing Functionality**
   - Maintain responsive design patterns
   - Keep all interactive elements functional
   - Preserve animation timing and effects
   - Maintain accessibility features

2. 🎨 **Adapt Design Elements**
   - Convert HTML to React 19 components
   - Replace vanilla JS with React hooks and patterns
   - Convert inline Tailwind classes to component-based structure
   - Ensure responsive design for mobile, tablet, and desktop
   - Maintain WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility standards
   - Use Lucide React icons instead of CDN version

3. 🔧 **Technical Adaptations**
   - Convert to TypeScript with proper interfaces/types
   - Use React 19 best practices (hooks, server components where appropriate)
   - Implement proper event handlers with TypeScript
   - Add error boundaries for component safety
   - Optimize with React.memo and useMemo where beneficial
   - Remove CDN dependencies (Tailwind, Lucide) and use npm packages

4. 📱 **Feature Integration**
   - Intersection Observer for scroll-triggered animations
   - Smooth scroll behavior for navigation
   - Hover state management for interactive cards
   - Responsive navigation with mobile menu
   - Loading states for images
   - Animation delay system for staggered effects

5. 🎯 **Specific Adaptations Needed**
   - Replace CDN Tailwind with local Tailwind configuration
   - Convert Lucide CDN to lucide-react npm package
   - Adapt animations to Framer Motion or CSS-in-JS
   - Implement dark/light mode compatibility (optional)
   - Create reusable sub-components (Navigation, BentoCard, StatCard, etc.)
   - Extract animation utilities to separate hooks (useScrollAnimation)
   - Type all props and component interfaces
   - Optimize images with Next.js Image component

**COMPONENT STRUCTURE:**
```
alimonyapp/componets/
├── medical/
│   ├── MedicalLanding.tsx (main component)
│   ├── Navigation.tsx
│   ├── HeroSection.tsx
│   ├── BentoGrid.tsx
│   ├── BentoCard.tsx
│   ├── StatCard.tsx
│   ├── CTASection.tsx
│   └── hooks/
│       └── useScrollAnimation.ts
└── types/
    └── medical.types.ts
```

**MULTIAGENT COORDINATION:**
Please use appropriate agent coordination:
- @agents-agument/core/ui-configurator-agent for design analysis
- @agents-agument/universal/react-developer for implementation
- Maintain context across agent handoffs
- Document all changes and decisions

**DELIVERABLES:**
1. ✅ Complete React 19 component implementation
2. ✅ Updated TypeScript interfaces/types
3. ✅ Tailwind CSS styling with design system tokens
4. ✅ Modular component architecture (max 500 lines per file)
5. ✅ Working animations and interactions
6. ✅ Responsive design for mobile/tablet/desktop
7. ✅ Documentation of component usage and props
8. ✅ Accessibility compliance (ARIA labels, semantic HTML)

**TESTING REQUIREMENTS:**
- Ensure the interface loads without errors
- Verify all interactive elements work (buttons, hover states)
- Test scroll-triggered animations
- Confirm responsive behavior on mobile (375px), tablet (768px), desktop (1440px)
- Validate navigation functionality
- Check accessibility compliance (keyboard navigation, screen readers)
- Test image loading and optimization
- Verify animation performance (60fps)

**DESIGN SYSTEM INTEGRATION:**
- Use design system tokens from designsystem.md
- No hard-coded colors, spacing, or typography
- Follow KISS and YAGNI principles
- Component-first architecture
- Vertical slice organization

**IMPLEMENTATION RULES:**
- One responsibility per file
- Max file length: 500 lines
- Modular design enforced
- Use relative imports
- No assumptions or hallucinated functions
- Confirm all paths and modules exist
- Never delete existing code
- Complete all related updates; no partial implementations

Please analyze the provided UI design and implement it step-by-step, maintaining modern React best practices while delivering the exact visual design requested.
